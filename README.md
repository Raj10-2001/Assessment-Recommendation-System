# SHL Assessment Recommendation System  

This project is a smart recommendation engine that helps hiring managers find the most relevant SHL assessments for a given job description. Instead of manually browsing the SHL product catalog, this tool takes natural language input and returns tailored recommendations â€” fast, easy, and efficient.

## How It Works  

*Input:* Natural language job description or role profile  
*Processing:* NLP-based keyword extraction and TF-IDF similarity scoring  
*Output:* A list of the *top 10 most relevant SHL assessments* with all required attributes:  

- *Assessment Name* (with direct link to SHL catalog)  
- *Remote Testing Support* (Yes/No)  
- *Adaptive/IRT Support* (Yes/No)  
- *Duration*  
- *Test Type*
